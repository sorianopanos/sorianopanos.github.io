Hi! I am physicist working on the characterization of social and  biological processes through the lens of complex systems science. I am currently a Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral researcher at [Universitat Rovira i Virgili](https://www.urv.cat/en/). Previously, I obtained my PhD in Physics in 2021 at [University of Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es) and held an independent PONTE postdoctoral fellow at the former Gulbenkian Institute for Science (now [Gulbenkian Institute of Molecular Medicine](https://www.gimm.pt)).

Research interests
------
As a complex systems scientist, my research interests cover multiple disciplines. Below you can find a list of my main current research interests:

1. Impact of human mobility on epidemics.
2. Dynamics of interacting spreading processes.
3. Emergence of echo chambers in social media.
4. Interplay between evolution and epidemics 

A complete list of my publications can be found in the [Publications](https://sorianopanos.github.io/publications) page.
