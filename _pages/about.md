Hi! I am physicist working on the characterization of social and  biological processes through the lens of complex systems science. I am currently a Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral researcher at [Universitat Rovira i Virgili](https://www.urv.cat/en/). Previously, I obtained my PhD in Physics in 2021 at [University of Zaragoza](unizar.es) and an independent PONTE postdoctoral fellow at the former Gulbenkian Institute for Science (now [Gulbenkian Institute of Molecular Medicine](https://gimm.pt)).

Research interests
------
As a complex systems scientist, my research interests cover multiple disciplines. Below you can find a list of my main current research interests:

1. Impact of human mobility on epidemics.
2. Dynamics of interacting spreading processes.
3. Emergence of echo chambers in social media.
4. Interplay between evolution and epidemics 

A complete list of my publications can be found in the [Publications](https://sorianopanos.github.io/publications) page.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
